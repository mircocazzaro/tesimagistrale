    Biomedical data management is increasingly complex due to the variety of storage systems and evolving data models. This heterogeneity presents obstacles to data integration and querying, crucial for advancing biomedical research and healthcare. The project will involve designing a system architecture that supports the integration of heterogeneous data stores under a unified federated system. The system will also utilize principles from the Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) paradigm to facilitate semantic querying capabilities. By developing a federated data analytics system for genomics data, this thesis will contribute to reducing the complexities involved in biomedical data management. The system will enable more effective data integration and querying processes, thereby supporting faster and more accurate genomics research. The completion of this project will result in a prototype of a federated data analytics system capable of handling the specific needs of genomics data.
